I am currently working at Amap, Alibaba Group, where I lead the AI algorithms team dedicated to advertising and intelligent creation. This encompasses tasks such as image generation for products and businesses, as well as AI-driven content generation for marketing purposes. My research interests are centered around multimodal understanding, controllable image generation and editing, poster generation, and unified understanding and generation models.

Since joining Alibaba in 2020, I have led teams on various projects, contributing to significant developments such as crowdsourced visual mapping for autonomous driving and indoor visual navigation systems. I possess extensive practical experience across multiple domains of computer vision, including visual perception, visual localization, pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction.

Prior to my work at Alibaba, I was part of the Intelligent Driving Department at NIO Inc. in Beijing, where I led a team that successfully deployed advanced features, including automated parking and Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS). This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the practical applications of computer vision technologies.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2016, and I hold a bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, awarded in 2011.
